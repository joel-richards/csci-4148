There are 2 packages you will need to install for today's practical: `install.packages(c("h2o", "eegkit", "forecast", "tseries")` apart from that everything else should already be available on your system.
However, I will endeavour to use explicit imports to make it clear where functions are coming from (functions without `library_name::` are part of base R or a function we've defined in this notebook).

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# experimenting with this ML library on my quest to find something pleasant to use in R
library(h2o)
h2o::h2o.init(nthreads = 1)

# EEG manipulation library in R (although very limited compared to signal processing libraries available in other languages, matlab might actually still be a leader in this specific area)
library(eegkit)

# some time series functions (that we only skim the depths of)
library(forecast)
library(tseries)

# just tidyverse libraries that should already be installed
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## EEG Eye Detection Data

One of the most common types of medical sensor data (and one that we talked about during the lecture) are Electroencephalograms (EEGs).  
These measure mesoscale electrical signals (measured in microvolts) within the brain, which are indicative of a region of neuronal activity.
Typically, EEGs involve an array of sensors (aka channels) placed on the scalp with a high degree of covariance between sensors.

As EEG data can be very large and unwieldy, we are going to use a relatively small/simple dataset today from [this paper](http://ehrai.com/su/pdf/aihls2013.pdf).

This dataset is a 117 second continuous EEG measurement collected from a single person with a device called a "Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset".
In combination with the EEG data collection, a camera was used to record whether person being recorded had their eyes open or closed. 
This was eye status was then manually annotated onto the EEG data with `1` indicated the eyes being closed and `0` the eyes being open.
Measures microvoltages are listed in chronological order with the first measured value at the top of the dataframe.

Let's parse the data directly from `h2o`'s test data S3 bucket:
```{r dataset}
eeg_url <- "https://h2o-public-test-data.s3.amazonaws.com/smalldata/eeg/eeg_eyestate_splits.csv"
eeg_data <- dplyr::as_tibble(h2o::h2o.importFile(eeg_url))

# add timestamp
Fs <- 117 / dim(eeg_data)[1]
eeg_data <- eeg_data %>% dplyr::mutate(ds=seq(0, 116.99999, by=Fs), eyeDetection=as.factor(eyeDetection))
print(eeg_data %>% dplyr::group_by(eyeDetection) %>% dplyr::count())

# split dataset into train, validate, test
eeg_train <- eeg_data %>% dplyr::filter(split=='train') %>% dplyr::select(-split)
print(eeg_train %>% dplyr::group_by(eyeDetection) %>% dplyr::count())

eeg_validate <- h2o::as.h2o(eeg_data %>% dplyr::filter(split=='valid') %>% dplyr::select(-split))
eeg_test <- h2o::as.h2o(eeg_data %>% dplyr::filter(split=='test') %>% dplyr::select(-split))
```
**0 Knowing the `eeg_data` contains 117 seconds of data, inspect the `eeg_data` dataframe and work out approximately how many samples per second were taken?**

There are approximately 128 samples per second.

**1 How many EEG electrodes/sensors were used?**

Looks like there are 14 sensors in the dataframe.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that we have the dataset and some basic parameters let's begin with the ever important/relevant exploratory data analysis.

First we should check there is no missing data!

```{r}
h2o::h2o.nacnt(h2o::as.h2o(eeg_data))
```

Great, now we can start generating some plots to look at this data within the time-domain.

```{r}
melt <- reshape2::melt(eeg_data %>% dplyr::select(-split), id.vars=c("eyeDetection", "ds"), variable.name = "Electrode", value.name = "microvolts")


ggplot2::ggplot(melt, ggplot2::aes(x=ds, y=microvolts, color=Electrode)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_line() + 
  ggplot2::ylim(3500,5000) + 
  ggplot2::geom_vline(ggplot2::aes(xintercept=ds), data=dplyr::filter(melt, eyeDetection==1), alpha=0.005)

```
**2 Do you see any obvious patterns between eyes being open (dark grey blocks in the plot) and the EEG intensities?**

There doesn't seem to be any patterns once the state transitions. However, when the eye opens, there is a sharp positive voltage spike, and a sharp negative one when the eye closes.

**3 Similarly, based on the distribution of eye open/close state over time to anticipate any temporal correlation between these states?**

The plot makes it seem like the eyes are open about as much as they are closed. This changes toward the end, when they're closed
much more than open.

Let's see if we can directly look at the distribution of EEG intensities and see how they related to eye status.

```{r}
melt_train <- reshape2::melt(eeg_train, id.vars=c("eyeDetection", "ds"), variable.name = "Electrode", value.name = "microvolts")

# filter huge outliers in voltage
filt_melt_train <- dplyr::filter(melt_train, microvolts %in% (3750:5000)) %>% dplyr::mutate(eyeDetection=as.factor(eyeDetection))

ggplot2::ggplot(filt_melt_train, ggplot2::aes(y=Electrode, x=microvolts, fill=eyeDetection)) + ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
```
Plots are great but sometimes so it is also useful to directly look at the summary statistics and how they related to eye status:


```{r}
filt_melt_train %>% dplyr::group_by(eyeDetection, Electrode) %>% 
    dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(microvolts), median=median(microvolts), sd=sd(microvolts)) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(Electrode)
```

**4 Based on these analyses are any electrodes consistently more intense or varied when eyes are open?**

More intense: F7, O1, O2, T8

More varied: F7, P7, O1, O2

#### Time-Related Trends

As it looks like there may be a temporal pattern in the data we should investigate how it changes over time.  
First we will do a statistical test for stationarity:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
apply(eeg_train, 2, tseries::adf.test)
```
**5 Why are we interested in stationarity? What do the results of these tests tell us? (ignoring the lack of multiple comparison correction...)**

Stationarity tells us whether the data has any significant changes in magnitude or variance over time. With p-vals of 0.01, we can reject the null and say that the data is stationary.

Then we may want to visually explore patterns of autocorrelation (previous values predict future ones) and cross-correlation (correlation across channels over time) using `forecast::ggAcf` function? 

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
forecast::ggAcf(eeg_train %>% dplyr::select(-ds))
```

**7 Do any fields show signs of strong autocorrelation (diagonal plots)? Do any pairs of fields show signs of cross-correlation? Provide examples.**

The fields most strongly autocorrelated are F7, FC5, FC6 and eyeDetection.

It looks like F7-FC5, T8-FC6, and F4-FC6 are cross-correlated.

#### Frequency-Space 

We can also explore the data in frequency space by using a Fast Fourier Transform.  
After the FFT we can summarise the distributions of frequencies by their density across the power spectrum.
This will let us see if there any obvious patterns related to eye status in the overall frequency distributions.

```{r, fft_open}
eegkit::eegpsd(eeg_train %>% dplyr::filter(eyeDetection == 0) %>% dplyr::select(-eyeDetection, -ds), Fs = Fs, xlab="Eye Open")
```

```{r, fft_closed}
eegkit::eegpsd(eeg_train %>% dplyr::filter(eyeDetection == 1) %>% dplyr::select(-eyeDetection, -ds), Fs = Fs, xlab="Eye Closed")
```

**8 Do you see any differences between the power spectral densities for the two eye states? If so, describe them.**

For open eyes, channels 6 and 14 are the strongest. This is different than closed eyes, where channels 1, 9 and 13 are strongest. The lower-power channels also appear to be more similar to each other when the eyes are open.

#### Independent Component Analysis

We may also wish to explore whether there are multiple sources of neuronal activity being picked up by the sensors.  
This can be achieved using a process known as independent component analysis (ICA) which decorrelates the channels and identifies the primary sources of signal within the decorrelated matrix.

```{r}
ica <- eegkit::eegica(eeg_train %>% dplyr::select(-eyeDetection, -ds), nc=3, method='fast', type='time')
mix <- dplyr::as_tibble(ica$M)
mix$eyeDetection <- eeg_train$eyeDetection
mix$ds <- eeg_train$ds

mix_melt <- reshape2::melt(mix, id.vars=c("eyeDetection", "ds"), variable.name = "Independent Component", value.name = "M")


ggplot2::ggplot(mix_melt, ggplot2::aes(x=ds, y=M, color=`Independent Component`)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_line() + 
  ggplot2::geom_vline(ggplot2::aes(xintercept=ds), data=dplyr::filter(mix_melt, eyeDetection==1), alpha=0.005) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_log10()
```

**9 Does this suggest eye activate forms an independent component of activity across the electrodes?**

The ICA seems to suggest that eye activity is an independent component. The majority of the activity in the plot is in the V1 channel, with just a little bit in the V3 channel. I don't see the V2 channel anywhere.

### Eye Opening Prediction

Now that we've explored the data let's use a simple model to see how well we can predict eye status from the EEGs:

```{r}
model.gbm <- h2o::h2o.gbm(x = colnames(dplyr::select(eeg_train, -eyeDetection, -ds)), 
                      y = colnames(dplyr::select(eeg_train, eyeDetection)),
                      training_frame = h2o::as.h2o(eeg_train),
                      validation_frame = eeg_validate,
                      distribution = "bernoulli",
                      ntrees = 100,
                      max_depth = 4,
                      learn_rate = 0.1)

print(model.gbm)
```

**10 What validation performance can you get with `h2o::h2o.xgboost` instead?**

We get similar performance using xgboost as with gbm. Scores are slightly lower with xgboost for the most part.

```{r}
model.xgb <- h2o::h2o.xgboost(x = colnames(dplyr::select(eeg_train, -eyeDetection, -ds)), 
                      y = colnames(dplyr::select(eeg_train, eyeDetection)),
                      training_frame = h2o::as.h2o(eeg_train),
                      validation_frame = eeg_validate,
                      distribution = "bernoulli",
                      ntrees = 100,
                      max_depth = 4,
                      learn_rate = 0.1)

print(model.xgb)
```

**11 Using the best performing of the two models calculate the test performance**

```{r test}
perf <- h2o::h2o.performance(model = model.gbm, newdata = h2o::as.h2o(eeg_test))
print(perf)
```

**12 Describe 2 possible alternative modelling approaches we discussed in class but haven't explored in this notebook.**

1. We could have used a hidden Markov model to model the transitions between eye-open/eye-closed states, and potentially some hidden ones.

2. We also could have used an ARIMA model to forecast the eye opening or closing. I'm not sure of the usefulness of such a model, but it's something we could consider doing.
